# Obstetrics — Normal Delivery, Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH), and Neonatal Resuscitation

## 1. Introduction and Scope

Field delivery support, prevention/management of PPH, and immediate neonatal resuscitation steps.

## 2. Epidemiology and Pathophysiology

Unplanned out-of-hospital deliveries are uncommon but high-impact; PPH remains a leading cause of maternal morbidity; neonatal transition requires rapid thermal management and airway support.

## 3. Prehospital Assessment

- Stage of labor; frequency/duration of contractions; urge to push; crowning
- Maternal vitals, bleeding assessment; fetal movement when applicable

## 4. Prehospital Management

### Normal Delivery

- Prepare clean area; gentle control of head; check for nuchal cord; support body and dry/warm newborn

### Postpartum Hemorrhage

- Uterine massage; quantify blood loss; consider oxytocin if available per protocol; treat shock; rapid transport

### Neonatal Resuscitation (NRP-aligned)

- Warm, dry, stimulate; position airway; clear secretions if needed; evaluate respirations/HR
- If HR < 100 or apnea/gasping: PPV with appropriate sized mask; monitor SpO2
- Escalate per NRP algorithm; consider BVM with oxygen; compression threshold HR < 60 after adequate ventilation

## 5. Variations, Pitfalls, Complications

- Shoulder dystocia maneuvers (McRoberts, suprapubic pressure)
- Breech and multiple gestations — rapid transport, supportive measures
- Maternal hypertension/eclampsia considerations

## 6. Scenarios and Expected Outcomes

- Uncomplicated delivery with vigorous newborn
- PPH controlled with uterine massage and shock management
- Neonate requiring brief PPV with recovery of HR and color
