# Tension Pneumothorax — Prehospital Research

## 1. Introduction and Scope
Recognition and immediate decompression of life-threatening tension pneumothorax in the field.

## 2. Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
Occurs in blunt and penetrating chest trauma; rising intrathoracic pressure collapses lung and impedes venous return → obstructive shock.

## 3. Prehospital Assessment
- Signs: unilateral absent/diminished breath sounds, hypoxia, hypotension, severe dyspnea; tracheal deviation is late
- Consider ultrasound where available (lung sliding absent)

## 4. Prehospital Management
- High-flow oxygen; prepare for immediate needle decompression when indicated
- Decompression sites: 2nd ICS MCL or 4th/5th ICS anterior axillary line (AAL) per protocol/device length and habitus
- Post-decompression reassessment; manage recurrence; rapid transport

## 5. Variations, Pitfalls, Complications
- Inadequate catheter length → failure; misplacement risks
- Hemothorax/hemopneumothorax considerations
- Bilateral tension physiology in severe chest trauma

## 6. Scenarios and Expected Outcomes
- Hypotensive trauma patient with improved BP/SpO2 immediately after decompression
