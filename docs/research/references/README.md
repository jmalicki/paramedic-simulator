# References Library — Workflow

Goal: Save authoritative papers/articles with concise prehospital-focused summaries to power protocol/scenario design and stats.

Each entry must include:

- Full citation (authors, year, title, journal), DOI/URL
- 3–5 sentence summary (methods, population, key findings)
- Prehospital relevance: 1–2 bullets on implications for EMS
- Tags: domain (medical/trauma/special), condition, type (guideline, RCT, observational, review)
- Notes: data extractable (incidence rates, effect sizes), limitations

Files

- `chf.md` — Acute decompensated heart failure / pulmonary edema
- `opioid-overdose.md` — Opioid overdose and naloxone
- `tension-pneumothorax.md` — Tension PTX and decompression
- `obstetrics.md` — Normal delivery, PPH, neonatal resuscitation

Conventions

- Use Markdown lists for entries; one section per paper.
- Use stable links (DOI, PubMed, publisher). Avoid news/blog.
- If paywalled, include PubMed/summary link and citation.
