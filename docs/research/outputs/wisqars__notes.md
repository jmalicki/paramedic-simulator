# WISQARS — Injury Mechanisms (Denominators)

Data: CDC WISQARS, public CSV exports

Planned pulls:
- Years: 2019–2024
- Variables: mechanism, age group, sex, counts (national)
- Use: denominators and trend context for trauma-related EMS scenarios

Files to be saved:
- `research/outputs/benchmarks/wisqars__injury_mechanisms__{YEAR}.csv`

Caveats:
- Category definitions differ from EMS coding; use for context only
- Document exact query parameters per file
