# Paramedic Simulator Research Library

This directory houses long-form, citation-rich research documents to support protocols and scenario design. Documents are organized by domain:

- Medical: `medical/`
- Trauma: `trauma/`
- Special Populations: `special/`

Each condition document follows a consistent structure:

1. Introduction and scope
2. Epidemiology and pathophysiology
3. Prehospital assessment (primary/secondary)
4. Management and protocols (with decision points)
5. Variations, pitfalls, and complications
6. Scenarios and expected outcomes
7. References (prehospital literature prioritized: JEMS, PEC, NAEMSP, AHA, NAEMT)
