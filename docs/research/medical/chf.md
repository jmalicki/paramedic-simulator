# Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (CHF) — Prehospital Research

## 1. Introduction and Scope

Focus: prehospital recognition and management of acute decompensated heart failure with pulmonary edema.

## 2. Epidemiology and Pathophysiology

High-burden EMS presentation among adults, particularly geriatrics; pathophysiology includes elevated preload/afterload, fluid redistribution to lungs, impaired gas exchange.

## 3. Prehospital Assessment

- Primary survey: respiratory distress, hypoxia, accessory muscle use
- Findings: rales, orthopnea, JVD, peripheral edema; consider differentials (COPD, pneumonia, PE)
- Diagnostics: SpO2, EtCO2 trends; 12-lead ECG for ischemia/arrhythmia

## 4. Prehospital Management

- Position of comfort (upright)
- Oxygen/CPAP for moderate–severe distress; titrate FiO2 and PEEP
- Nitrates (if protocol and SBP adequate): reduce preload/afterload; monitor BP closely
- Consider bronchodilator only if bronchospasm suspected (wheezing in CHF is common but not always bronchospasm)
- Avoid excessive fluids
- Early notification; consider STEMI activation if indicated

## 5. Variations, Pitfalls, Complications

- Hypertensive flash pulmonary edema: aggressive nitrate strategy per protocol
- Hypotension: avoid nitrates; consider cardiogenic shock pathway
- Misclassification as COPD → delayed CPAP/nitrates

## 6. Scenarios and Expected Outcomes

- Severe pulmonary edema responding to CPAP + nitrates with improved SpO2/RR
- CHF with concurrent STEMI requiring dual pathway management
