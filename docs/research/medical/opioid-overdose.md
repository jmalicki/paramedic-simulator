# Opioid Overdose and Naloxone — Prehospital Research

## 1. Introduction and Scope
Focus: recognition of opioid toxidrome and titrated naloxone for respiratory depression.

## 2. Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
High-incidence EMS call type; µ-opioid receptor agonism depresses respiratory drive → hypercapnia and hypoxia.

## 3. Prehospital Assessment
- Toxidrome: CNS depression, hypoventilation, miosis (not universal)
- Measurements: RR, SpO2, EtCO2 (elevated), glucose; evaluate for co-ingestants
- Airway/ventilation first (BVM) if apneic or severely hypoventilating

## 4. Prehospital Management
- Airway support with BVM; adjuncts as needed
- Naloxone: titrate to adequate ventilation and protective airway reflexes; routes: IN/IM/IV per protocol
- Anticipate re-sedation (long-acting opioids) and precipitated withdrawal
- Monitor capnography and reassess frequently; consider transport refusal policies carefully

## 5. Variations, Pitfalls, Complications
- Mixed overdoses (benzodiazepines, alcohol) → incomplete response
- High-potency synthetics → require higher/serial dosing
- Rapid, full arousal → agitation and aspiration risk

## 6. Scenarios and Expected Outcomes
- Severe respiratory depression reversed to adequate ventilation with incremental naloxone
- Recurrence of hypoventilation requiring repeat dosing/transport
